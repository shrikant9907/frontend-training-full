git init

# Creating a new repository on GitHub
# Follow the instructions on GitHub to create a new repository
```

### Day 2: Basic Git Commands
- Initializing a new Git repository
- Adding files to the staging area
- Committing changes to the repository
- Checking the repository status
- Viewing the commit history
```bash
# Initializing a new Git repository
git init

# Adding files to the staging area
git add <file1> <file2>

# Committing changes to the repository
git commit -m "Commit message"

# Checking the repository status
git status

# Viewing the commit history
git log
```

### Day 3: Branching and Merging
- Creating a new branch
- Switching between branches
- Merging branches
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Deleting branches
```bash
# Creating a new branch
git branch <branch_name>

# Switching between branches
git checkout <branch_name>

# Merging branches
git merge <branch_name>

# Resolving merge conflicts
# Open the conflicted file, resolve conflicts, and save changes
git add <resolved_file>
git commit -m "Merge branch_name"

# Deleting branches
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

### Day 4: Collaborating with Others
- Cloning a remote repository
- Forking a repository on GitHub
- Making changes and submitting a pull request
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Syncing a local repository with upstream changes
```bash
# Cloning a remote repository
git clone <repository_url>

# Forking a repository on GitHub
# Click on the "Fork" button on the repository page

# Making changes and submitting a pull request
# Make changes to the cloned repository
git add <file1> <file2>
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin <branch_name>
# Create a pull request on the repository's page on GitHub

# Reviewing and merging pull requests
# Review the pull request on GitHub, leave comments if necessary
# Merge the pull request on GitHub

# Syncing a local repository with upstream changes
git remote add upstream <upstream_repository_url>
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

### Day 5: Advanced Git Features
- Creating and applying patches
- Using Git stash to temporarily store changes
- Using Git rebase to modify commit history
- Working with submodules
- Git ignore patterns

```bash
# Creating and applying patches
git diff > my_patch.patch
git apply my_patch.patch

# Using Git stash to temporarily store changes
git stash
git stash pop

# Using Git rebase to modify commit history
git rebase -i <commit_hash>

# Working with submodules
git submodule add <repository_url>
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Git ignore patterns
# Create a .gitignore file and specify patterns for files to ignore
```
### Day 6: GitHub Workflow
- Setting up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
- Creating and managing GitHub Issues
- Using labels and milestones
- Assigning and mentioning collaborators
- Commenting on and closing issues

```bash
# Setting up GitHub Actions for continuous integration
# Create a workflow file (e.g., .github/workflows/ci.yml) and define the workflow

# Creating and managing GitHub Issues
# Create and manage issues on the repository's page on GitHub

# Using labels and milestones
# Add labels and milestones to issues on the repository's page on GitHub

# Assigning and mentioning collaborators
# Assign issues to collaborators and mention them in comments on GitHub

# Commenting on and closing issues
# Comment on issues and close them using keywords (e.g., "Fixes #1") on GitHub
```
