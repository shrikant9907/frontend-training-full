### Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript

Understand the basics of JavaScript, including variables, data types, and operators.
Learn how to write and execute JavaScript code in the browser console.
Example:
```js
// Declare a variable and print a message
var message = "Hello, JavaScript!";
console.log(message);
```

### Day 2: Control Flow and Loops

Explore control flow statements such as if-else, switch, and ternary operators.
Learn about loops like for, while, and do-while for repetitive tasks.
Example:
```js
// Perform a conditional check
var num = 10;
if (num > 0) {
  console.log("Number is positive");
} else {
  console.log("Number is negative");
}

```
