### Day 1: Introduction to React.js

What is React.js?

React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render those components as the underlying data changes. React.js follows a component-based approach, where the UI is divided into modular components that can be easily composed together.
Setting up a development environment (Node.js, npm, create-react-app)

Install Node.js and npm to manage dependencies.
Use the create-react-app tool to quickly set up a new React.js project with the necessary configuration and folder structure.
React components and JSX syntax

Learn about React components, which are the building blocks of a React application.
Understand JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code.
Rendering elements

Explore how to render React elements to the DOM.
Use ReactDOM.render() to render a React component to a specified container element.
Example Code:
```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Day 2: Components and Props

Functional components vs. class components

Understand the difference between functional components and class components in React.
Functional components are simple functions that return JSX, while class components are JavaScript classes that extend the React.Component class.
Props: passing data to components

Learn how to pass data from a parent component to a child component using props.
Props are read-only and allow you to customize the behavior or appearance of a component.
Component composition and reusability

Explore how to compose React components by nesting them within other components.
Reusable components help maintain a modular and scalable codebase.
Example Code:
```js
import React from 'react';

const Greeting = (props) => {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Greeting name="John" />
      <Greeting name="Jane" />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Day 3: State and Lifecycle

State and its importance in React

Understand the concept of state in React.
State represents the mutable data within a component and is used to manage component behavior and reactivity.
Class component state and setState method

Learn how to define and update state in a class component.
Use the setState() method to update the state and trigger a re-render of the component.
Lifecycle methods (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount)

Explore the lifecycle methods available in React class components.
componentDidMount is called after the component is rendered for the first time, componentDidUpdate is called after a component's update, and componentWillUnmount is called before a component is removed from the DOM.
Example Code:
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Timer extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { seconds: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerId = setInterval(() => {
      this.setState((prevState) => ({
        seconds: prevState.seconds + 1,
      }));
    }, 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerId);
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Seconds: {this.state.seconds}</div>;
  }
}
```

### Day 4: Handling Events

Event handling in React

Learn how to handle events in React components.
React uses synthetic events that wrap the native browser events and provide a consistent interface across different browsers.
Binding event handlers

Understand the importance of binding event handlers in React.
Ensure that the correct value of 'this' is maintained when the event handler is called.
State updates through event handlers

Update component state based on user interactions within event handlers.
Modify the state using this.setState() to trigger a re-render and reflect the updated state in the UI.
Example Code:
```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  incrementCount() {
    this.setState((prevState) => ({ count: prevState.count + 1 }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.incrementCount()}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```
